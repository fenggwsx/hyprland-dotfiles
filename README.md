## About This Repository

This repository stores the user configuration files of my Hyprland desktop. Everyone can clone and use it. However, I highly suggest you **TAKE THESE CONFIGURATION FILES AS A REFERENCE ONLY** because they may contain something related to my computer so they may not work well if you simply clone the whole repository into your own computer. Also, I suggest you install the packages and softwares before using my configuration files.
